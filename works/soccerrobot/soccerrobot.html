<h3>Soccer Robot Soccer</h3> was a project I did in grade 11 for my Computer Engineering class. Everyone was to create the best robot they could to compete in a provincial RoboCup tournament held at my school. The original design was mainly 3d printed and won the tournament at the school, meaning our team moved on to the worlds held in the Netherlands. For this competition I made the structure out of carbon fiber to save weight. The robot used three ultrasonic sensors, an IR reciever to detect the ball, a compass and an Arduino to control everything. The video is not of my personal robot, but the robots shown were created by teammates the next year.
