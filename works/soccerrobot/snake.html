<h3>Snake</h3> is an ongoing project that has gone from a simple one player game to an eight player installation. Started in first year as a final project for processing, it was a two player game that used a library to play using two computers. It has since been extended to a projection mapping project. The lastest version has four two player games going on at the same time, projected onto a 10 inch square box. To control the snakes, each player uses an iOS device and the TouchOSC app with a custom layout to send the conroller data to the computer running the installation.
